                I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. My hobbies include hiking, camping, playing video games and anything else that I can find entertaining for at least a few minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I dabbled while in college, tryng things from acting to coding, bio to archaeology, never really settling on any one subject until I finally decided I had no idea what I wanted to do and withdrew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I have been trying things and working for the almighty dollar and have finally decided that I wanted to do something more fulfilling and could pay for my constant dabbling.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a lot of research I found myself joining this bootcamp to try to more fully immerse myself in a skill I had only dipped my toes in previously.
